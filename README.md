## Code Examples

### Adding an Event

```javascript
const handleEventSubmit = () => {
  const newEvent = {
    id: editingEvent ? editingEvent.id : Date.now(),
    date: selectedDate,
    time: `${eventTime.hours.padStart(2, '0')}:${eventTime.minutes.padStart(2, '0')}`,
    text: eventText,
  }
  let updatedEvents = [...events]
  if (editingEvent) {
    updatedEvents = updatedEvents.map((event) =>
      event.id === editingEvent.id ? newEvent : event,
    )
  } else {
    updatedEvents.push(newEvent)
  }
  updatedEvents.sort((a, b) => new Date(a.date) - new Date(b.date))
  setEvents(updatedEvents)
  setEventTime({ hours: '00', minutes: '00' })
  setEventText('')
  setShowEventPopup(false)
  setEditingEvent(null)
}
```

---

### Calendar Navigation

```javascript
const prevMonth = () => {
  setCurrentMonth((prevMonth) => (prevMonth === 0 ? 11 : prevMonth - 1))
  setCurrentYear((prevYear) => (currentMonth === 0 ? prevYear - 1 : prevYear))
}

const nextMonth = () => {
